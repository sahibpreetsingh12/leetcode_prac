"""
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

Why this works
1. Youâ€™re looking for the integer square root of a non-negative integer x.
2. The square root of x is the largest integer y such that y * y <= x.
3. You can use binary search to efficiently find the integer square root.
4. Initialize two pointers, left and right, to 1 and x respectively.
5. While left is less than or equal to right, calculate the midpoint.
6. If mid * mid equals x, return mid.
7. If mid * mid is less than x, move the left pointer to mid + 1.
8. If mid * mid is greater than x, move the right pointer to mid - 1.
9. When the loop ends, right is the largest integer where right * right <= x.
10. Return right as the integer square root of x.
