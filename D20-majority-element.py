"""
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

# Explanation: The problem is asking for the majority element in an array, which is the element that appears more than n/2 times.
# The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is an efficient way to find the majority element in linear time and constant space.
# The algorithm works by maintaining a count of the current candidate for the majority element and adjusting it based on the elements in the array.
# The key idea is that if the count drops to zero, we pick a new candidate.
# This works because the majority element appears more than half the time, so it will always be the last candidate standing.
# Approach:
# 1. Initialize a candidate variable and a count variable.
# 2. Iterate through the array:
#    - If the count is zero, set the current element as the candidate and set count to 1.
#    - If the current element is the same as the candidate, increment the count.
#    - If the current element is different, decrement the count.
# 3. After iterating through the array, the candidate will be the majority element.
