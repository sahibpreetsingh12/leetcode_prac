"""
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, 
and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 
respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, 
but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a 
length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, 
and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.


Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined 
elements coming from nums1.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only 
there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

        Since we have to do inplace operation so 
        Steps below:-
        1. Take the first m elements from nums1 (the actual numbers we care about, ignoring the extra zeros at the end).
        2. Combine these m elements with all the elements from nums2 to make a new temporary list.
        3. Sort this temporary list so all numbers are in order (smallest to largest).
        4. Copy the sorted numbers back into nums1, replacing everything in nums1 with these sorted numbers.
        5. Check if there are any zeros in nums1 that shouldnâ€™t be there and remove them 
            (this step is only needed for some edge cases).
        6. Logic of removing zeros is -> Any Zero which is followed by larger number is useful because
            it can be part of the pattern whereas any zero which is followed by another number 
            smaller than it is not useful for us (because we are sorting them in ascending order)
            So order like ---> -2,-1,0,0,1 is fine 
            whereas -2,-1,0,-3 is useless we can remove that zero

        # Step 4: Copy sorted elements back to nums1
        for i in range(len(t)):
            nums1[i] = t[i]

"""
Another Approach using STL

1. Traverse through nums2 and append its elements to the end of nums1 starting from index m.
2. Sort the entire nums1 array using sort() function.


Complexity
Time complexity: O((m+n)log(m+n)) -due to the sort() function

Space complexity: O(1)
We are not using any extra space, so the space complexity is O(1)
