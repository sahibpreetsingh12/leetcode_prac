Approach:
1. Define a `TreeNode` class to represent each node in the binary search tree (BST).
2. Define a `Solution` class with a method `getMinimumDifference` that takes the root of the BST as input.
3. Use a helper function `collect` to traverse the tree and collect all node values in a list.
4. Sort the collected values to prepare for finding the minimum absolute difference.
5. Initialize a variable `min_diff` to infinity to keep track of the minimum difference found.
6. Iterate through the sorted values and calculate the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive values.
# 7. Update `min_diff` if the current difference is smaller than the previously recorded minimum.
7. Return the smallest absolute difference found.
