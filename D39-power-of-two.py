Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1
Example 2:

Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
Example 3:

Input: n = 3
Output: false

"""
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.
Approach:
    1. Check if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, return `False` since negative numbers and zero cannot be powers of two.
    2. Use the `math.log2` function to calculate the base-2 logarithm of `n`.

Approach:
1. Check if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, return `False` since negative numbers and zero cannot be powers of two.
2. Use a while loop to repeatedly divide `n` by 2 as long as `n` is even (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`).
3. After the loop, check if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, return `True`, indicating that `n` is a power of two.
4. If `n` is not equal to 1, return `False`, indicating that `n` is not a power of two.
